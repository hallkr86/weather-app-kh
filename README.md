This is an application where the user enters the city of their choice to view the weather.  The application should show the current temerature, humidity, and wind speed. Additionally, the page should also show a five day forecast below showing similar inforamtion.

If the user decides to search for another city, they can type in the new city and it current weather and 5 day forecast will populate the page.
